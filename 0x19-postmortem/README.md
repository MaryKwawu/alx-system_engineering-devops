Title: Postmortem - Nginx Configuration Update Incident on Assignment 0x0E-web_stack_debugging_1

Introduction:
Welcome to our postmortem for the recent Nginx configuration update incident that occurred on 2023-08-07. During this hour-long outage, the primary website (www.example.com) and its subdomains were unavailable, causing HTTP 502 errors and impacting around 60% of our users. In this postmortem, we will analyze the timeline, root cause, and actions taken to swiftly resolve the issue. Additionally, we will outline the corrective and preventative measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Issue Summary:
Duration: 1 hour, 2023-08-07 15:00 to 2023-08-07 16:00 (UTC)
Impact:
The Nginx web server experienced an outage for one hour, resulting in HTTP 502 errors and unavailability of the primary website
Approximately 60% of users were affected during the incident.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the Nginx server's symbolic link creation process inadvertently replaced the main configuration with an incomplete default configuration, causing the outage.

Timeline:
- 2023-08-07 15:00 (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts, indicating HTTP 502 errors on the website and subdomains.
- 2023-08-07 15:05 (UTC): Incident escalated to the on-call DevOps team responsible for Nginx configuration.
- 2023-08-07 15:10 (UTC): Initial assumption of a code deployment issue; investigation focused on application server logs and deployment history.
- 2023-08-07 15:20 (UTC): Engineers investigated the application server infrastructure for resource constraints.
- 2023-08-07 15:30 (UTC): Engineers noticed recent Nginx configuration update and shifted investigation accordingly.
- 2023-08-07 15:40 (UTC): Root cause identified as a misconfiguration in the symbolic link creation process.
- 2023-08-07 15:45 (UTC): Incident escalated to Nginx server administration team.
- 2023-08-07 16:00 (UTC): Nginx configuration rolled back to the previous version; web server successfully restarted.
- 2023-08-07 16:05 (UTC): Incident resolved; website and subdomains verified to be functioning correctly.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The main cause of the incident was a misconfiguration in the Nginx server's symbolic link creation process. The command used to enable a custom configuration mistakenly created a symbolic link pointing to an incomplete default configuration, leading to the Nginx server's failure and HTTP 502 errors.
Resolution: To resolve the incident, the Nginx configuration was rolled back to the previous version, containing the correct and complete configuration settings. The team also verified the proper functioning of the website and subdomains after restarting the Nginx server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. **Automated Configuration Deployment:** Develop an automated configuration deployment process using a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) to ensure consistent and error-free configuration updates.
2. **Configuration Review Workflow:** Establish a formal configuration review workflow, requiring peer review and validation before applying changes.
3. **Version Control for Configurations:** Utilize Git for version control of Nginx configuration files, enabling easy tracking and rollback of changes.
4. **Automated Configuration Testing:** Create automated tests to validate Nginx configurations for syntax errors and compatibility.
5. **Regular Configuration Backups:** Implement a scheduled backup strategy for Nginx configuration files, stored securely and periodically tested for data integrity.
6. **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up real-time monitoring for Nginx server performance, error logs, and resource usage to detect and respond to issues promptly.
7. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a comprehensive incident response plan for Nginx-related issues, outlining roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures.
8. **Audit Symbolic Link Creation:** Audit and validate the symbolic link creation process to ensure it points to the correct configuration file.
9. **Training and Knowledge Sharing:** Conduct training sessions and knowledge sharing among team members to improve Nginx configuration management skills and best practices awareness.

Conclusion:
By addressing the root cause and implementing corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent future incidents and enhance the reliability and stability of our Nginx server infrastructure. Thank you for your understanding and support as we continue to prioritize the seamless operation of our services
